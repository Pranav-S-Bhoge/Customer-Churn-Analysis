# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project involves helping a telecoms company better understand its customer churns. 

The goal is to create an easy-to-use dashboard for them to identify which customer segments are likely to churn in the future. 

In addition, communicate any additional insights or improvements about the business can make based on the given dataset about their customers.
